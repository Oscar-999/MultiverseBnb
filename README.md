## Code I'm Proud Of

```javascript
// Get all spots owned by the current user
router.get("/current", requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.user.id;

  const spots = await Spot.findAll({
    where: {
      ownerId: userId,
    },
    include: [
      {
        model: SpotImage,
        as: "SpotImages",
        where: { preview: true },
        required: false,
      },
      {
        model: Review,
        as: "Reviews",
        attributes: [
          [sequelize.fn("AVG", sequelize.col("Reviews.stars")), "avgRating"],
        ],
        required: false,
      },
    ],
    group: ["Spot.id", "SpotImages.id", "Reviews.id"],
  });

  const formattedSpots = spots.map((spot) => {
    let avgRating = 0;

    if (spot.Reviews && spot.Reviews.length > 0) {
      avgRating = parseFloat(
        spot.Reviews[0].getDataValue("avgRating")
      ).toFixed(1);
    }

    const previewImage =
      spot.SpotImages && spot.SpotImages.length > 0
        ? spot.SpotImages[0].url
        : null;

    return {
      id: spot.id,
      ownerId: spot.ownerId,
      address: spot.address,
      city: spot.city,
      state: spot.state,
      country: spot.country,
      lat: spot.lat,
      lng: spot.lng,
      name: spot.name,
      description: spot.description,
      price: spot.price,
      createdAt: spot.createdAt,
      updatedAt: spot.updatedAt,
      avgRating: avgRating,
      previewImage: previewImage,
    };
  });

  res.status(200).json({ Spots: formattedSpots });
});
```
Explanation :
Route Setup: The code sets up an Express.js route at "/current" for handling GET requests.

User Authentication: It checks if the user is authenticated (logged in) using the requireAuth middleware.

Database Query: It queries a database table called "Spot" to find spots owned by the current user based on their ID.

Data Retrieval: The code also fetches associated data like spot images and reviews while ensuring that only preview images are included.

Data Formatting: It calculates the average rating of reviews for each spot and formats the data into a more user-friendly structure.

JSON Response: Finally, it sends a JSON response containing the formatted spot data back to the client.

In short, this code handles authenticated requests to retrieve and format spot-related data from a database, making it ready for a response in a well-structured JSON format.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:

   `

   `
2. Install denpendencies into the Backed and the Frontend by making a terminal for each one and then run the following:

   * `npm install`

3. Create a **.env** file using the **.envexample** provided

4. Set up your database with information from your .env and then run the following to create your database, migrate, and seed:

   * `npx dotenv sequelize db:create`
   * `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`
   * `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`

5. Start the app for both backend and frontend using:

   * `npm start`

6. Now you can use the Demo User or Create an account
